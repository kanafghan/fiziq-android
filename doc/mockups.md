# Mockups
The following mockups and the related description represent the functional requirements of the Fiziq app.

## Sign Up
The very first time a user starts the app, he/she must sign up in order to relate all the logged data
to him/her. The **Sign Up** view is the first that a user encounters. The sign up process is very simple;
the user must provide his/her name and an e-mail address. By tabbing the `Register` button and after a
successful registration (sign up) the user will be taken to the [Home](#Home) view. The following mockup
illusrates how the **Sign Up** view can look.
